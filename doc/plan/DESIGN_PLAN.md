## Introduction


## Overview

* **Front End API** 
  * External
    * We might not have to use an

![This is cool, too bad you can't see it] ()
* `CommandInputBox`: this class accepts user text input, maybe a button to load input from an external file.
* `UserFunctions`: Displays user defined functions(commands) if any exist.
* `Variables`: Displays user defined variables, if any exist.

* `TurtleScreen`: biggest component of the UI, the main "canvas" which visualizes the turtle movement.
* `ToolBar`: At the top of the window, has commands to change canvas color, background color, turtle design, language, the "Info" screen.
