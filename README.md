### Impressions

* Luka-
    * It was a very hard project. But I think I personally learned a lot and got the opportunity to
      practice the new topics learned in class. I think I did some of the best "architecture" design
      I have ever done in my life. But the project was still very challenging. learned more about
      how javaFX works as well.
